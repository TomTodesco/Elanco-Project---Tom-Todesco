Student Name: Tom Todesco<br>

# Project Outline
This repository contains a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) web application developed as part of the Elanco 2026 Placement.
This application allows users to visualise tick sightings across the Uk and display the statistics of each area to help users identify high risk areas, so that they can be prepared if they were to visit or avoid completely overall. It includes an interctive map for them to look at and check markers on the map highlighting areas with tick sightings, a filter system is included to allow for ease of use if users don't want to navigate through all of the markers and woud rather look at specific areas, speicies information and prevention tips to help users identify the tick they are dealing with and good ways to prevent themselves from catching these insects, a form submission to allow users to report their own sightings to the websight to allow for increased awareness between users.

<li>Click on codespace</li>
<li>If you don't have code space:</li>
<ul>
<li>Go to a new tab and search github codespace, then login to your github account and download codespace</li>
</ul>
<li>Create a new codespace in main<li>
<li>Once in the codespace make sure live server is installed</li>
